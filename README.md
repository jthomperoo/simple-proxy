# Simple Proxy

This is a simple HTTP/HTTPS proxy - designed to be distributed as a self-contained binary that can be dropped in
anywhere and run.

Code based on the guide here: <https://medium.com/@mlowicki/http-s-proxy-in-golang-in-less-than-100-lines-of-code-6a51c2f2c38c>

## Features

- HTTP and HTTPS.
- Can choose which port to run on.
- Can specify paths to certificate and private key file to use.
- Logs each proxied connection.
- Log options can be supplied using `glog`.
  - Can choose the log verbosity with the `-v` flag.
  - Can choose to log to a file.
- Basic authentication.
- Can log request headers.
- Can log failed authentication attempt details.
- Printing version number.

## Install

You can download the latest release for your architecture and operating system from [the releases
page](https://github.com/jthomperoo/simple-proxy/releases).

Once you unzip the release package you can either run the binary directly, or you can add it into your PATH so it can
be called from anywhere (e.g. the `/usr/bin` directory).

### Linux AMD64

You can use `wget` to download and install the program to your `/usr/bin` directory by running these commands:

```bash
wget https://github.com/jthomperoo/simple-proxy/releases/download/v1.1.1/simple-proxy_linux_amd64.zip
unzip -d simple-proxy simple-proxy_linux_amd64.zip
cp simple-proxy/simple-proxy /usr/bin/simple-proxy
rm -r simple-proxy/ simple-proxy_linux_amd64.zip
```

```bash
./simple-proxy
```

## Windows

## Checking the proxy is working

You can use [cURL](https://curl.se/) on Linux/MacOS systems to check if your proxy is working:

```bash
curl --proxy 'http://localhost:8888' 'https://www.random.org/integers/?num=1&min=1&max=5&col=1&base=10&format=plain&rnd=new'
```

This will reach out to [random.org](https://www.random.org) to fetch a random number, using the default proxy address
and port.

On Windows you can use:

```powershell
curl.exe --proxy 'http://localhost:8888' 'https://www.random.org/integers/?num=1&min=1&max=5&col=1&base=10&format=plain&rnd=new'
```
